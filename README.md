# KK_Plugins

Plugins for Koikatsu, EmotionCreators, and AI Girl

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of: 
    - [BepInEx v5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
    - [BepisPlugins](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins/releases)
    - [IllusionModdingAPI](https://github.com/IllusionMods/IllusionModdingAPI)
2. Download the plugin release you want from the links below. Make sure it's a version for your game.
3. Extract the plugin .zip file to your game folder (where the BepInEx folder and game .exe is).

## Plugin descriptions and downloads

Make sure you download the version for your game (the first part before _ is the initials of the game, e.g. HS2 = HoneySelect2).

If a plugin is listed but it's not a link, then it's either experimental or obsolete. You will need to compile it from source yourself, and you will not get any support.

Select an uncensor for your character in the character maker in the Body/General tab or specify a default uncensor to use in the plugin settings. The default uncensor will apply to any character that does not have one selected.

Requirements:
* Marco's [KKAPI](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI/releases)
* Marco's [Overlay Mods](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods/releases)
* [BepisPlugins](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins/releases) ExtensibleSaveFormat and Sideloader.

For makers of uncensors, see the [template](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/blob/master/src/UncensorSelector.Core/Template.xml) for how to configure your uncensor for UncensorSelector compatibility.

Make sure to remove any sideloader uncensors and replace your oo_base with a clean, unmodified one to prevent incompatibilities!

#### PoseTools

- [AI_PoseTools]
- [HS2_PoseTools]
- [KK_PoseTools]
- [KKS_PoseTools]
- [PH_PoseTools]

This plugin is aimed at increasing the usability of poses. You can create new folders in userdata/studio/pose and place the pose data inside them and those folders will show up in your list of poses in Studio. It also saves poses as .png files instead of .dat so you see can see what the content of the pose is. The list of poses is ordered by filename and the pose name is added to the file name so the list will be ordered alphabetically. It also saves skirt FK and facial expressions, though these can be disabled in plugin settings if you prefer.

Ported from Essu's NEOpose List Folders plugin for Honey Select.

#### ListOverride

- [KK_ListOverride]
- [KKS_ListOverride]

Allows you to override vanilla list files. Comes with some overrides that enable half off state for some vanilla pantyhose.

Overriding list files can allow you to do things like enable bras with some shirts which don't normally allow it, or skirts with some tops, etc. Any part of of the list can be changed except for ID.

#### HairAccessoryCustomizer

- [EC_HairAccessoryCustomizer]
- [KK_HairAccessoryCustomizer]
- [KKS_HairAccessoryCustomizer]

Adds configuration options for hair accessories to the character maker. Hair accessories can be set to match color with the hair, enable hair gloss, modify outline color, and has a separate color picker for the hair tie part. Hairs that support a length slider can also have their length adjusted, just like vanilla front hairs. Saves and loads to cards and coordinates.

**Note for modders**: These options will only show up for hair accessories that are properly configured. For accessories to work the accessory must have a		`ChaCustomHairComponent` MonoBehavior in addition to the `ChaAccessoryComponent` MonoBehavior. Hair accessory color will display if the ChaCustomHairComponent rendAccessory array has meshes configured. The length slider will appear if the `ChaCustomHairComponent.trfLength` array has bones configured. Hair color will only match to meshes configured in the `ChaCustomHairComponent.rendHair` array. Also check out [this guide](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/wiki/Hair-Accessory-Guide) for how to create hair accessories.

- [HS2_MaterialEditor]
- [KK_MaterialEditor]
- [KKS_MaterialEditor]
- [PH_MaterialEditor]

MaterialEditor is a plugin that allows you to edit many properties of objects that aren't usually accessible in game. Much like [Marco's clothing overlays](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods) you can replace the texture of an item, however with MaterialEditor you can edit much more than clothes. Edit clothes, accessories, hair, and even Studio items.

Features:
* Export UV maps of a mesh to help with drawing textures
* Replace nearly any texture with custom textures
* Change properties of materials to control things like shininess or outline thickness
* Change properties of the mesh to affect whether it casts shadows or disable a mesh completely
* Change the shader of a material
* All changes save and load with the card or Studio scene
* Duplicate textures are saved to the card once. 100 accessories with the same texture have the same file size as one accessory with a texture

Access the Material Editor by pressing the "Open Material Editor" button on clothes, hair, or accessories in the character maker. Access it in Studio by pressing the "Mat. Editor" button on the Workspace with a studio item selected.
